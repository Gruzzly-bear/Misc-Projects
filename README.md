# The Den

 This is a repo of different projects I may have worked on or created in my free time that have no real repo of their own. 
 Feel free to look around.
 
 # Links
- [WoW Dwarven chat addon](https://github.com/Gruzzly-bear/The-Den/tree/master/DwarvenChat)
This add-on takes text input in real time and adds a dwarven accent to it.
- [IOS Pythonista Scripts](https://github.com/Gruzzly-bear/The-Den/tree/master/IOS%20Pythonista%20sync%20scripts)
These are useful scripts to sync to and from dropbox using pythonista on IOS.
- [Twitter post bot](https://github.com/Gruzzly-bear/The-Den/tree/master/TwitterBot)
This will automatically post to twitter using their API.
- [Facebook post bot](https://github.com/Gruzzly-bear/The-Den/tree/master/Facebook%20Bot)
This will automatically post text or images to your facebook wall.
- [Twitter Image Bot](https://github.com/Gruzzly-bear/The-Den/tree/master/Twitter%20Image%20Bot)
This was created before I added both images and texts into the final Twitter bot. This bot only pulls images and posts them. Great for Advertisements.

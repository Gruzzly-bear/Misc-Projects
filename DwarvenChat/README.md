# What is it?
This addon auto translates your input text and outputs modified text that resembles a dwarven accent.
## For example:
``` What are you saying? I can't hear you! ``` <br/>
becomes <br/>
``` What're ye sayin'? I cannae hear ye! ``` <br/>
This happens as soon as you press enter. It is very fast, and fluid.

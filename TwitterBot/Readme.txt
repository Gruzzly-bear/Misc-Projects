Thanks for your purchase!
This readme will list everything you need to do to get it up and working!
The first thing you will need is a twitter account.
Once you have that, make sure you link it to a phone number.
This needs to be done in order to create an application on twitter's API.
After you have a phone number linked and your account looking good, head to https://apps.twitter.com/
Click on Create new app.
Give it a name. Most of this information are just placeholders.
Give it a small description.
Set the website. You can just use a placeholder for it like this - http://website.com/
Tick yes for developer agreement.
After it is created, goto the key's and access token tab at the top.
Copy the Consumer key and the consumer secret.
Goto access token. Click generate new.
Copy both of those tokens.
OPen up the settings.cfg with notepad.
Input all the files as they request.
The sleep option is how many seconds you want it to tweet. The interval. 900 = 15 mins
After you input all the required information. Save it.
Goto tweet.txt
Follow the instructions in there.
After all that is set up, run the script and watch the magic happen!

Don't forget, you can set it to run under startup applications.
You can also use a VBS script to make it run hidden on windows.

Happy tweeting!
